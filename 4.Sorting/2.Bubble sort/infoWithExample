Bubble osrt is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent element if they are in wrong order.
Example:
5 1 4 2 8 this algorithm working compares the first two element and swap... then this condition repeated.
now the array is already sorted ,but our algorithm does not know if it is completed. the algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.
worst and Average case time complexity: O(n*n) reverse sorted.
best case time complexity :O(n) array is al sorted.
boundary cases:bubble sort takes minimum time (order of n) when elements are already sorted.
