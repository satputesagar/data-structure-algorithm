insertion sort is a simple sorting  algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards playing cards in your hands,
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

Algorithm:
 to sort an array of size n in ascending order.
 1. iterate from arr[1]  to arr[n] over the array.
 2. compare  the current element (key) to its predecessor.
 3. If the key element is smaller than its predecessor campare it to the elements before.
 move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.

 Example:
 12   11 13 5 6
 let up loop for i =1 (second element of the array) to 4
 (last element of the array)
 i=1 ,Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and insert 11 before 12
 11 12 13 5 6
 .

 .
 i=4, will move to position after 5, and elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
 5 6 11 12 13
